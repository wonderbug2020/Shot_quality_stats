# Overview 

This project is in the very early stages and very much a work in progress. The basic idea is to showcase my data science skills by applying them to the statistical analysis of NHL. At this stage, I am currently recreating work done by others but in python. I plan to gradually build out and add my own personal flair to the project as I go along.

## Technologies used

Right now, this is exclusively being done in python but might migrate to a web app in the future. Currently pandas, numpy, and sklearn at the main libraries being used for the analysis and machine learning model. Minor libraries like time are just used for debugging purposes. 

## Acknowledgements

At this stage I am following along with a write up by by evolving hockey where they go into detail on how to use their script that is written in R. This write up is located [here](https://evolving-hockey.com/blog/a-new-expected-goals-model-for-predicting-goals-in-the-nhl/). The play-by-play (pbp) data used for this portion is, understandably, behind a paywall on their site. 

However, if one is inclined, a proper scrapper could recreate this from data provided by the NHL and conveniently collected by [meta hockey](http://metahockey.com/resources/data/sources/)

Data obtained from [Moneypuck](http://moneypuck.com/data.htm) and [Hockey reference](https://www.hockey-reference.com/) are used for comparison and verification.
